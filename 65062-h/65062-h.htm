<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The modern idea seems to be that poetry has no relation to life. Life in
the modern sense is action, progress, success. Poetry has been conceded
special themes: it can deal with passion,&mdash;the strange and unnatural and
unreal physical attraction of the sexes&mdash;with nature, with the symbols
of mythology, and with the characteristic sentimental heroism of history
and events. With reality, it must have nothing to do. It is supposed, by
the modern world of Anglo-Saxon literalness, to create an atmosphere of
illusion, which one must avoid to keep one’s emotions from going astray
in a civilization that needs the hardest kind of common sense. It is
paradoxical that the English-speaking people who have given the world
the greatest poets, should take this false attitude while in possession
of the greatest spiritual and imaginative legacy of life and experience,
bequeathed them from one generation to another during the last four
hundred years.</p>

<p>Escaping the illusion, this modern world has become the prisoner of
delusion. For, if poetry deals with anything, it deals with reality. No
matter how remote the setting, how subtle the communication, the one
hard fact about true poetry, is its reality. The poet at the core and
centre of life, surrounded with his dreams, his clairvoyant madness
imbibed from the full draught of experience, his intensity of emotion,
his childlike tenderness of sympathy, his quickening ecstasy of
unashamed and unrestrained feeling, is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> the abnormal product
of modern civilization; while in truth he is alone the one normal type
of modern mankind, because he alone is in absolute harmony and
understanding with the real and common impulse of human destiny.</p>

<p>The great secret of life is to discover by a process of related effects,
this common reality of experience. Most of mankind grope blindly in the
dark, and miss it, and by a kind of frenzied and pitiable ignorance
acquire the abnormal character of conduct. The poet discovers, or at
least puts his being wholly at the disposal of, these secrets, wins a
serene and contemplative relationship to these effects, and lives a
normal spiritual life. Harmony and rhythm are but two common terms that
express and designate infinity. There was a man who was so absolutely
sane that the scoffers of his day called him mad&mdash;this man was William
Blake. Christ was a madman to the community of his day, even his closest
friends and disciples were not without doubt at times as to his sanity.
But these two men were never a hair’s breadth from the commonest reality
of existence. They realized imaginative facts, and kept in absolute tune
with the harmony and rhythm of life, not merely with what they saw with
the actual eye, but with that more penetrative, more limitless sense,
the seeing soul. They were poets, and the one insistent quality of their
message, was the reality of mortal and immortal life.</p>

<p>It is hard to make a certain type of mind understand that all which is
seen with the physical eye, and touched with the fleshly hand, is
illusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> That kind of a mind does not understand symbols. It belongs
to the so-called practical people of the world, who obey, but do not
comprehend, laws; whose laws, indeed, are the conventions of minds
similar to their own. They organize, but do not construct; they
interpret, but do not create. They are the wheels, and not the
motor-power, of the engine of civilization and humanity. These are the
people who make up nine-tenths of the world’s population; without the
other tenth, they would perish. Their reality in life is mathematical
immediacy, the cloak of visibility in which they are wrapped to go about
their daily tasks in the world. Now poetry sees in these people and
their affairs only the symbols of what is real, looks upon their whole
fantastic display of living as the illusion beneath which their real
living is concealed; the crises of their joys and sorrows, their
aspirations and passions, hidden in the reality of their consciousness
where exists an infinite universe of being, and where every event of
their lives is enacted before their shadow is thrown upon the stage of
the world. The fact of life is there, hidden away in the solitary soul,
determining the illusions of conductual existence. It is crowded with
moods, emotions and feelings, experienced with such intensity that what
breaks forth in actual deed and event is but a faint reflection of the
real experience the soul has gone through. The ideal is the real,
because it is what one has lived but cannot express in the related
experience of human intercourse.</p>

<p>Poetry comes nearer finality in embodying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> exact meaning and
intensity of human feeling than any other art. Human feeling, being the
root of all individual intelligence, is the most inexplicable quantity
in life. Intuition is the primary significance of our existence. And it
is the quality which gives to poetry its visionary and spiritual
substance. In a nation it is the register of a people’s culture.</p>

<hr />

<p>The study of poetry in the magazines which I began ten years ago, has
grown into the convincing evidence of the following pages of this book.
During this time we have passed through a number of phases in our
national life; but through these changing aspects of national
aspirations, there has run, like a widening and brightening strand of
culture, the development of a new period of poetry, both in its
productive and appreciative aspects. From 1900 to 1905, poetry had
declined; and I think there has never been another period in our history
when so unintelligent and indifferent an attitude existed toward the
art. The scale since 1905 has been ascending, and the high pitch of
achievement has not yet been reached. Whether fine poetry creates a
general and popular recognition of the art, or the sympathetic
appreciation of poetry for itself encourages excellent production, I
cannot say. But this is apparent: that a period or epoch of the highest
achievement has always been one of popular appreciation.</p>

<p>A factor that should be taken into consideration, and which affects
poetry and its audience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> is the attitude of the book reviews in our
most influential literary journals. A characteristic example is the New
York Nation, which has been in the habit of grouping in a few articles
during the year with indiscriminate selection, the volumes of poetry
which it receives. In these reviews there is a supercilious and academic
attitude which dismisses really important work with opinions which have
every suggestion of preconceived judgment. One has only to turn back his
files to the review of Masefield’s “Everlasting Mercy” and “The Widow in
the Bye Street,” to see the type of poetry reviewing that is more common
than uncommon in American periodicals and newspapers. I do not mean to
make The Nation an exception, but an illustration of the kind of
stewardship with which reviewers in some of our most authoritative
publications perform the duties of a serious and distinguished branch of
American authorship.</p>

<p>To show that there is a quality of poetry in our national production
worthy of pride and support, it has been my privilege for a number of
years to emphasize in an annual review the distinction of the verse in
the magazines. Out of these reviews has grown a demand for a more
permanent preservation of the best work, resulting in this annual
“Anthology of Magazine Verse,” to which are added records, references,
and criticisms, which constitute a “Year-Book of American Poetry.” While
all the other arts have had this service performed in their interests,
poetry, the one art that most needed such a special reinforcement of
its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> achievement, has been permitted to drift along throughout our
entire critical history without this sort of attention.</p>

<p>The poetry in the magazines this year has been of an excellence in the
longer pieces beyond the standard of any year in which I have made these
estimates. The selections in this volume give evidence of a serious,
even anxious, probing of human life. The lyric, represented by some
lovely work, has not been practiced with the same irresponsible
emotional delight as in past years. Perhaps, there has never been a year
when the American poets have shown the independence of their own
efforts, when comparatively new work has been so free from English
influences. What influences there are, seem to come from French sources.
<i>Vers libre</i> has been taken out of the hands of weak and pompous
innovators, and made a distinctive medium by a few earnest and powerful
singers. The most notable distinction in this respect is to be found in
the work of James Oppenheim, whose book, “Songs for the New Age,” is a
milestone in our poetic progress. So is Vachel Lindsay’s new work. He
has mastered a new form of poetic expression in his volume “The Congo
and Other Poems.” Miss Amy Lowell, in the better parts of “Sword Blades
and Poppy Seed,” is working toward a new elasticity in rhythm, which is
beginning to produce effective and beautiful results. On the other hand
Mr. Arthur Stringer in “Open Water” utterly fails to embody in actual
performance the principles expounded in the introduction to that
volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> though this introduction is as important a piece of critical
writing in English upon the subject as I know. No matter how
revolutionary they attempt to be in expression, there is still in these
writers a traditional note imbuing the substance which makes up the
significant part of their creativeness.</p>

<p>The selections in this volume are chosen from all kinds and methods of
poetic expression, and the reader’s attention is invited to their
differences in many aspects&mdash;though the aspect of quality is, I think,
of equal attainment in all&mdash;of such poems as Bliss Carman’s Phi Beta
Kappa Poem, Percy MacKaye’s “Fight,” Vachel Lindsay’s “The Firemen’s
Ball,” Eloise Briton’s “The Two Flames,” Conrad Aiken’s “Romance,” Olive
Tilford Dargan’s “Old Fairingdown” and “Path Flower,” Joyce Kilmer’s
“Twelve-Forty-Five,” and Don Marquis’s “The God-Maker, Man.” Of the
shorter pieces, I think the standard is decidedly above last year’s
quality. Mahlon Leonard Fisher has again followed the success of
previous years with his sonnet “Afterwards,” which sustains his position
as one of the foremost sonnet-writers this country has yet produced.
This poet has the unusual distinction of a fine reputation without
having published a book, but his definite contribution to American
poetry will soon take place with the publication of his first volume,
“An Old Mercer, and Other Poems.” A poem likely to create a profound
impression is Don Marquis’s “The God-Maker, Man,”&mdash;a fine achievement,
not only for its flashing images, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span> for spiritual substance shaped
with compelling conviction.</p>

<p>The selections in this volume reflect the extraordinary richness of the
published volumes this year. I do not recall any year of the past decade
when the quantity and quality alike have been so notable. The autumn
season’s publication of verse usually shows a preponderance in quality
of books by English poets, who seem to meet with more favorable
consideration from the best established publishers. There have been this
year a number of notable volumes by English poets brought out in this
country, but the balance of distinction, both in standard and numbers of
books, belongs this year most emphatically to the American poets.
Thirty-five volumes of distinguished poetry stand to our credit, and
these are only a selection from a larger number of books which merit
appreciation. Books by Louis V. Ledoux, George Edward Woodberry, Louis
Untermeyer, Walter Conrad Arensberg, William Rose Benét, Vachel Lindsay,
George Sterling, Olive Tilford Dargan, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson,
Conrad Aiken, James Oppenheim, Harry Kemp, Amelia Josephine Burr, Joyce
Kilmer, Amy Lowell, Percy MacKaye, Arthur Davison Ficke, Edwin Markham,
Agnes Lee, and Bliss Carman, are among those which have advanced the
significance of the year’s output.</p>

<p>The European war has had a more immediate effect upon literature than
almost anything else. All books of a non-military character published
just before the war, with the exception of poetry, have been thrown into
relatively ineffective sig<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span>nificance. Poetry endures because it is
integrally woven with the warp of man’s real existence, and not of that
illusory substance, of which other kinds of imaginative literature are
fashioned, and which has been so easily wiped away by this war’s primal
brutality. And poetry has aspired to sustain the nobler part of man’s
nature during the confusion into which civilization has been plunged
since the war began. The English people, who have been in the world’s
vanguard practising democratic ideals, have, in their poets to-day,
shattered the idol of war and are glorifying the ideals of peace.</p>

<p>The best poems in English directly inspired by the war have been
produced by American poets. Of these I have gathered a representative
group in this volume. The work achieved by Percy MacKaye on different
phases of the European war has made more secure than ever his position
as a poet. It is no exaggeration to say that the two groups of sonnets
which originally appeared in the <i>Boston Transcript</i> in August and
September, and which are now included in his volume, “The Present Hour,”
are comparable as a whole to William Watson’s “The Purple East,” and in
such individual pieces as “Kruppism,” and “The Real Germany,” he has
done work finer and more impressive than is to be found in any of the
older writer’s sonnets. Moreover, such pieces as “If!” and “The Other
Army,” by Bartholomew F. Griffin; “Prelude,” by Edmond McKenna; “He Went
for a Soldier,” by Ruth Comfort Mitchell, and “To a Necrophile,” by
Walter Conrad Arensberg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> are striking and spontaneous poetry of a high
order. In E. Sutton, a poet is presented, who has produced martial
poetry in “The Bugle,” “The Drum,” and the stirring “Pipes of the
North,” which, for swinging rhythm and profound reflection upon the pomp
and futility of military glory, has not been equalled by any
contemporary poet.</p>

<p>A notable feature of the poetry year is the Kennerley edition of Walt
Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.” The works of Whitman have been transferred
from publisher to publisher so often, that there has been little
opportunity for their circulation among the people for whom he wrote.
This edition contains the text and arrangement preferred by the poet
himself, and is the only perfect and complete issue, comprising one
hundred and six additional poems not included in any other edition.
There are suitable editions to meet the demand of all classes of Whitman
enthusiasts and students: an India paper edition bound in leather, a
library edition bound in cloth, and two issues of a Popular edition,
bound in cloth and in paper respectively. To these are added the
“Complete Prose” in a Library and Popular edition in cloth. None of the
leading American poets of the past generation have been so unfortunate
in publication; and many who believe Whitman to be America’s greatest
poet will be glad to know, that now, by the authorization of his
executors, all his works are gathered in uniform editions under one
imprint.</p>

<p>Other important new editions of poetry are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span> cheap reissue by the
Oxford University Press of John Sampson’s final and authoritative text
of William Blake’s complete poems, and the new reprint in Bohn’s Popular
Library issued by The Macmillan Company of Henry Vaughan’s Complete
Poems.</p>

<hr />

<p>As in former years in my annual summary in the <i>Boston Transcript</i>, I
have examined the contents of the leading American magazines. To the
seven magazines which I examined last year,&mdash;namely, <i>Harper’s</i>,
<i>Scribner’s</i>, <i>The Century</i>, <i>The Forum</i>, <i>Lippincott’s</i>, <i>The Smart
Set</i>, and <i>The Bellman</i>,&mdash;I have added this year three monthlies, <i>The
Trend</i>, <i>The International</i>, and <i>The Masses</i>; and one quarterly, <i>The
Yale Review</i>. <i>The Bellman</i> still maintains its high poetic distinction,
by virtue of which it prints more good poetry than any other American
weekly, and most American monthlies. As last year, I have winnowed from
other magazines distinctive poems for classification and notice:&mdash;one
each from <i>The Metropolitan</i>, <i>The Craftsman</i>, <i>The Poetry Journal</i>, the
<i>Southern Woman’s Magazine</i>, <i>Puck</i>, and <i>The Infantry Journal</i>; and two
each from <i>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, and the <i>Outlook</i>; while from three newspapers I have selected
fourteen poems:&mdash;eleven from the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, two from
the <i>Boston News Bureau</i>, and one from the <i>New York Evening Sun</i>. In
quoting from the <i>Boston Transcript</i>, I wish to testify to the ready
recognition and encouragement this daily paper has offered to poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> and
poetry. It is one of the paper’s finest traditions.</p>

<p>The poems published during the year in the eleven representative
magazines I have submitted to an impartial critical test, choosing from
the total number what I consider the “distinctive” poems of the year.
From the distinctive pieces are selected fifty-two poems, to which are
added thirty from other magazines and from newspapers not represented in
the list of eleven, making a total of eighty-two, which are intended to
represent what I call an “Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1914.”</p>

<p>Quoting from what I have written in previous years, to emphasize the
methods which guided my selections, the reader will see how impartial
are the tests by which the distinctive and best poems are chosen: “I
have not allowed any special sympathy with the subject to influence my
choice. I have taken the poet’s point of view, and accepted his value of
the theme he dealt with. The question was: How vital and compelling did
he make it? The first test was the sense of pleasure the poem
communicated; then to discover the secret or the meaning of the pleasure
felt; and in doing so to realize how much richer one became in a
knowledge of the purpose of life by reason of the poem’s message.”</p>

<p>In one hundred and forty-seven numbers of these eleven magazines I find
there were published during 1914 a total of 647 poems, of which 157 were
poems of distinction. The total number of poems printed in each
magazine, and the number of the distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span> poems are: <i>Century</i>, total
71, 19 of distinction; <i>Harper’s</i>, total 39, 10 of distinction;
<i>Scribner’s</i>, total 49, 18 of distinction; <i>Forum</i>, total 33, 13 of
distinction; <i>Lippincott’s</i>, total 56, 8 of distinction; <i>The Smart Set</i>
(excluding November and December), total 148, 18 of distinction; <i>The
Bellman</i> (until November 7th), total 42, 23 of distinction; <i>The Yale
Review</i>, total 19, 10 of distinction; <i>The Trend</i> (April, and June to
November), total 51, 16 of distinction; <i>The Masses</i> (excluding
December), total 53, 13 of distinction; <i>The International</i> (excluding
November and December), total 86, 9 of distinction.</p>

<p>Following the text of the poems making the anthology in this volume, I
have given the titles and authors of all the poems classified as
distinctive, published in the magazines of the year; in addition I give
a list of all the poems and their authors in the one hundred and
forty-seven numbers of the magazines examined, as a record which readers
and students of poetry will find useful.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness and thanks to the editors of
<i>Scribner’s Magazine</i>, <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, <i>The Forum</i>, <i>The Century
Magazine</i>, <i>The Outlook</i>, <i>Lippincott’s Magazine</i>, <i>The Bellman</i>, <i>The
Smart Set</i>, <i>The Yale Review</i>, <i>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse</i>, <i>The
Poetry Journal</i>, <i>The International</i>, <i>The Masses</i>, <i>The Metropolitan</i>,
<i>Harper’s Weekly</i>, <i>The Craftsman</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The Southern Woman’s
Magazine</i>, <i>Puck</i>, <i>The Infantry Journal</i>, <i>The Boston News Bureau</i>,
<i>The New York Evening Sun</i>, and the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, and to
the publishers of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> magazines and newspapers, for kind permission
to reprint in this volume the poems making up the “Anthology of Magazine
Verse for 1914.” To the authors of these poems I am equally indebted and
grateful for their willingness to have me reprint their work in this
form. Since their appearance in the magazines and before the close of
the year when the contents of this volume was made up, twenty-eight
poems herein included have appeared in volumes of original poetry by
their authors. For the use of “Yankee Doodle” and “The Firemen’s Ball”
by Vachel Lindsay, included in his volume “The Congo, and Other Poems”;
of “Fight,” “France,” and “Six Sonnets (August, 1914)” by Percy MacKaye,
included in his volume “The Present Hour”; and for “Romance” by Conrad
Aiken, included in his volume “Earth Triumphant,” I have also to thank
The Macmillan Company, under whose imprint these volumes appear. Similar
acknowledgment is due to the George H. Doran Company for permission to
reprint “The Twelve-Forty-Five” by Joyce Kilmer, included in his volume,
“Trees and Other Poems”; and to print “In the Roman Forum” and “A
Lynmouth Widow” by Amelia Josephine Burr, included in her volume “In
Deep Places.” I am grateful to Charles Scribner’s Sons for two poems by
Olive Tilford Dargan, “Old Fairingdown” and “Path Flower,” included in
her volume “Path Flower”; and for two poems by Corinne Roosevelt
Robinson, “From a Motor in May,” and “If You Should Cease to Love Me,”
included in her volume “One Woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span> to Another.” I am indebted to Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley for kind permission to reprint Sonnets XXIX, XXX, and
XXXVII from “Sonnets of a Portrait-Painter”; and to Mr. A. M. Robertson
for two poems by George Sterling, “Ballad of Two Seas” and “The Hunting
of Dian,” included in his volume “Beyond the Breakers, and Other Poems.”
Finally, The Century Company have been kind enough to permit me to
republish “Landscapes” and “Summons” by Louis Untermeyer, from his
volume entitled “Challenge”; and “Patterns,” “A Handful of Dust,” and
“We Dead” by James Oppenheim, from his volume entitled “Songs for a New
Age.” If I have omitted any acknowledgments, it is quite unintentional,
and I trust that any such omission will be regarded leniently. I wish it
to be understood that the privilege extended to me so courteously, by
the authors, magazine editors and publishers, and book publishers, to
print the poems in this volume, does not in any sense restrict the
authors in their rights to print the poems in volumes of their own or in
any other place. I wish to thank the <i>Boston Transcript</i> for the
privilege of reprinting material in this book which originally appeared
in the columns of that paper.</p>

<p>A new feature this year is the series of critical summaries of new
volumes of verse, which are significant, and which have been appraised
in accordance with the same principles as the poems in the “Anthology of
Magazine Verse.” It is believed that by adding this feature, the book
will more nearly approximate to being an actual Year-Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> of American
Poetry, and it is in this belief that a subtitle has been added to this
volume. I believe that not only libraries, but private individuals will
welcome the selected lists of the best volumes for library purchase,
graded according to the requirements of a large or a small purse. A list
is also subjoined of the best books <i>about</i> poetry, and if there seems
to be a demand for this innovation, it is planned next year to include
in the book critical summaries of these volumes, as well as of the
volumes of original verse.</p>

<p>I shall be grateful for suggestions as to improvements of this year-book
in future years, and as to valuable extensions of its scope. To all
friends who have assisted this volume by their personal efforts, and to
the readers of past years who have made this annual publication possible
by promoting it through their interest in poetry, I tender my grateful
thanks. They are too many to name here, but my gratitude for their
efforts is none the less sincere.</p>

<span class="i0">Plattsburgh&mdash;and windless beauty on the bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Autumnal morning and the sun at seven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southward a wedge of wild ducks in the heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Dwindles, and far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim mountains watch the lake, where lurking for their prey<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flutters the trembling blue with snowy flecks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gunner, on Macdonough’s silent decks,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Peers from his cannon’s rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring beyond the low north headland. Crest on crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind green spruce-tops, soft as wild-fowls’ necks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glide the bright spars and masts and whitened wales<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of bellying sails.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chubb, Linnet, Finch, and lordly Confiance<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Leading with Downie’s crew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And blacken the roofs, like swarms of roosting choughs.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Waiting the cannon’s roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nation holds its breath for knell of Nevermore<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">One moment on the quarter-deck Jock kneels<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Toward God, to whom appeals<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of man, still boastful of his brother’s blood.&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Around his waist, and watches casually<br /></span>

<span class="i8">And spreads his spurs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Smoke belches black. “Huzza! That’s blowed ’em pocky!”<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Flutters, but proudly rallies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To broadside, while her gunboats range the water-alleys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Downie grips Macdonough in the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And double-shotted from his roaring flail<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Hurls the black hail.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The hail turns red, and drips in the hot gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jock snuffs the reek and spits it from his mouth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Steals from his mother’s porch in his still sleeping-room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilacs! But now it stinks of blood and drouth!<br /></span>

<span class="i8">“God! This is fight!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">Strangling with wires.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fight! But no more the roll of chanting drums,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Now noisome anguish numbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sense, that mocks and leers at monstrous vacuums.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whang!</i> splits the spanker near him, and the boom<br /></span>

<p>(From the first Khandaka of the Mahavagga: “There Buddha thus
addressed his disciples: ‘Everything, O mendicants, is burning.
With what fire is it burning? I declare unto you it is burning with
the fire of passion, with the fire of anger, with the fire of
ignorance. It is burning with the anxieties of birth, decay and
death, grief, lamentation, suffering and despair.... A disciple,
... becoming weary of all that, divests himself of passion. By
absence of passion, he is made free.’<span class="lftspc">”</span>)</p>

<span class="i0">The constancy of flowers; the blind belief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ivy climbing slowly toward the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eternal struggles and eternal deaths&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the groping faith of every root!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of old graves arose the cry of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the dying came the deathless call.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dear, foolish fragments made me strong again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valiant adventures, dreams of those to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the vague, heroic hopes of youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fresh abandon, like a fearless laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped up to face the heaven’s unconcern....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;veil upon veil was torn aside&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stars, like a host of merry girls and boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danced gaily ’round me, plucking at my hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night, scorning its ancient mystery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned down and pressed new courage in my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hermit-thrush, throbbing with more Song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang with a happy challenge to the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, and the faces of a world of children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept like a conquering army through my blood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Beauty, rising out of all its forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty, the passion of the universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flamed with its joy, a thing too great for tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a wine, poured itself out for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drink of, to be warmed with, and to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refreshed and strengthened to the ceaseless fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet with confidence the cynic years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Battling in wars that never can be won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the lost cause and the brave defeat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Surge upon surge, many-nationed, O City far-famed for the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy cavernous iron streets and thy towers half hung in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising in layer on layer, twelve cities piled upon one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All feeding and sleeping and breeding, enormous, half palace, half den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ever a tide washing through thee whose clamoring waters are men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O where is the hand of thy builder? What god, canst thou tell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On thy night-blooming lamps in rows on thy beautiful Avenue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have stood with a seaman’s glass on the roofs of thy high hotels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have rolled through the sheer ravines where the cliff dweller dwells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have peered from the place of the Tomb far up where the hills break free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the length of the lordly River comes down as a bride to the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have fled with a roar through the rock where the myriad lights flash by;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the ocean comes in to caress thee, O Beautiful One;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the days and the years of my life are a gift unto thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I dwell in thy marvelous gates, O Goddess cast up by the sea!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have surged with the morning throng down the gulf of the Great White Way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gashes thy granite length from the towers of sleep to the Bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the West rolls in with a rush and the North comes down with a roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tramp of the Island men is loud on thy island shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoulder to shoulder they come from the loins of a hundred lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men with the New World brains and the men with the Old World hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vision is bright on the sky of the City to be<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As a surf is the sound of thy labor, O City; as wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the hum of thy human streets filled with faces divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from building on populous building thy power unfurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaps down to the sea and off through the air to the ends of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have loafed round the banging wharves where the foreign freighters lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have watched the bridge-weaving shuttles pass over the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have felt the quick leap of thy drills where the builders of Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing the rock from the hole in the ground for the walls of thy home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have heard far down through the canyons the clamor and yell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the brokers are out with their signs and the Curb is a hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have sounded thy chattering markets; I have watched the noon hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come over thy toiling miles with a slack of thy terrible power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When story on story lets out on the pavement below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy streets are a-swarm with the Jew and the parks overflow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-famed is the rustling hour when the shoppers flow in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For miles thy walks are abloom and the monstrous fairs begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the aisles of the merchants are crowded, and dark-faced boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are out on the corners with flowers, and fakirs are there with their toys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have paused with the passing throng where the hoyden sea wind whirls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisks round the tall gray towers the skirts of the laughing girls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have watched round the wonder of windows the beauty and grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have breasted the streaming throngs and have come to the quiet place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Fountain, and weary with tramping have lounged on the benches there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the homeless man of the streets, the man with the unkempt hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have given him soul for soul as we watched far up in the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The just-seen worker wave and the slab of marble rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its place on the fortieth story. Still lit by the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the face of the golden clock when the toil of the day is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the long gray miles are a-murmur and the builders come down from the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Speed throws her myriad shuttles and the ambulance hurries by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the foam of the evening papers is white on the living sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep defiles are black with men as far as the eye can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loaded trains rush north and west from thy mighty central heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rivers foam and the bridges sag till their strong steel cables start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Rock drinks in its thousands from the moving flood in the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the strong male tide goes out with the roar of a million feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know when the night comes down that a beautiful Siren awakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have seen the flash of her eyes and the light that her shadow makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the rain-wet Avenue when the flutes of pleasure are heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she dances her way to the wine cup and sings like a bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hand in hand go the sons of Youth and the daughters of Beauty divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the children of Hunger are there who have trodden the grapes of their wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thousands pour and pour through the huge illumined Fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the booths of a hundred lands are bright and the Wonder-worker is there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red star is out on the roof and the horses are off on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the girl and the dog are blown along and the flashing water fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flush of thy far-flung revel goes up to the ribbons of sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forgotten Orion sinks down and the Pleiades die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have trailed down the pleasant river; I have tramped where the iron “L’s”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go thundering down through the haunts of care; I have slummed through the hidden hells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have jostled the mingling Bowery where the stream of the races rolls;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know the town where the yellow man goes by on his velvet soles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have threaded the still, dark canyons where the clustered towers rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a foot is heard of the thousands; they are ghosts on the midnight skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have seen o’er the glamour of waters thy piles upon shadowy piles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing out on the canvas of night and twinkling for miles upon miles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a grail is the gleam of thy towers and the glow of the Great White Way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a thousand ships have sailed and sailed to the lure of the lights on the Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spell of thy song, O Enchantress, is sweet on the southern air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shepherd far out on the plains feels the sting of thy hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art young with the youth of them, strong with the strength of them, filled with the beauty of girls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy throat where the River gleams is beaded with lamps as with pearls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the languor of night is around thee and the waters rise and fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over invisible bridges slow fireworms crawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Ferries that glide o’er the bay, o’er the rivers that lave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feet of thy emerald towers, are lighted swans on the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Merlin had walked o’er thy waters, or Prospero’s eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were watching alternate old cities line out on the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moment Jerusalem gleams and thy towers are holy and white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, at the turn of a glass, old Babylon etched on the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With high summer gardens abloom and the wealth of the world in her hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Carnival laughs in thy streets and Cairo is there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbaric all over with brooches and fountains of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the new day quenches the lamps and flares over Tyre.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Behind my mask of life there lies a shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein two flames are burning. Day and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tend these leaping treasures that are mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These lambent loves, the red one and the white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, priestess-like, I hang at either glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each is perfect. And to each I bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oil of pure emotion, hottest so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw new strength from my own offering.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first of these my loves burns as a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lifts its keen, white glory into space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With virgin fervor, lavishing afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its vivid purity: and in the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of changeful worlds it glows unaltered still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So burns my flame of friendship. In its sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things are silvered with a new delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beauty’s self strikes deeper, till the thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mere existence vibrates like a string.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then life is grown so taut that it must sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the little hills must clap their hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul is free as never bird on wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe in friendship like a sea of light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever as it mounts the sea expands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In new infinities, and each new height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows keener than the last, until the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For very dizziness sweeps downward then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To simpler things, the cadence of a voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sweet, low laughter, idle as the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fleeting touch of hands that quick rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ask no more and do not touch again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this white flame there comes a strange new peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep tranquillity unknown beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all my life’s cross-currents shift and cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like runways in the sand before the tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that I have longed to be, the brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High dreams of youth that languished nigh forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem half accomplished. Easy now to slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At tasks colossal, so my friend fail not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am filled with gentle wonderment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life can be so good and breath so sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all my world grows suddenly complete.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I must love it with a new content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So speech grows overfull, and we are fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drink of silence like a golden cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wine of sweet companionship filled up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That has no end, nor any thirst can drain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so at last no wish is left to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save thus to dream into eternity.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">The second flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burns red and fierce as noon-time on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild, full-blooded love that sprang to birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked and unafraid, yet scorning shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clean as winds that sweep the desert’s breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My flame of passion this, born of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm red earth, so æon-long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In languid, throbbing noons, when dust was pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To amorous dust, and longing made it one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a good love too, and must be so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though bloodless fathers crushed it and denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on a cross of virtue crucified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This firm sweet flesh that colors with our soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye! it is good, and beautiful, and clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel within my veins the surge and flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of young desire waking, that the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm universe has felt: to call, and preen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance before my mate that he may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An answering surge, and leap, and make me his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad with every fecund thing that is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God! It is good to feel the primal cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep, mad longing for another life,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life and his, that shall be born of me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little child of flame, that when we die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may cheat time, nor perish in the strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in this hour of vital ecstasy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When life is molten, we may stamp thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our own glad image, and conceive, and live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet it is, and languid, when the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has ebbed, for lack of more than I can give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take his hand who breathes so close beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay it on my breast, and humble me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say: “Thou art my lord. Thy will my own.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So at the last this wish is mine, to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck at the high-tide into nothingness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die, ere he can learn to love me less.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So these my loves are perfect, each alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient in itself and all complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one of two, like rival beacons shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That call and call me, but that never meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yet they have not met, nor ever burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white flame in the red, the red in white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till both were wed together there, and turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some half-dreamed intensity of light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Not two but one, a perfect, living whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this a dream? Are all great lovers dreams?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can red and white be fused, or two be one?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yseult and Eloise, are they but themes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sullen, tributary world comes near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before all-subjugating Rome to bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the pavement of the Forum rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathless Victory’s exultant tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the heavy march of captive kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here stood the royal dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sculptured immortality; their gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote above the turmoil of the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoarse with its living struggle at their feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here spoke the law&mdash;that voice of bronze was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By all the world, and stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The latent mind of nations in the bud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with the laurels, bitter with the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heroes upon heroes was this place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the strong heart of an imperial race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat with the essence of a man’s life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Princes and people evermore at strife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incense and worship&mdash;clash of armored rage&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition soaring up the sky like flame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Interminable war that mortals wage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From century to century the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still Fortune holds the crown for those who dare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind in many a distant otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaps panting toward the promise of her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here, no more of coveting nor care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer here the weltering human tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sluices the market-place and scatters wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weak as foam, to perish where they list.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by the Sovereign Silence purified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spring showers all with fragrant amethyst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were once these pulses violent and swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those that shake the cities of to-day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How indolently sweet the petals drift<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From yonder nodding spray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warming their broidered raiment in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little-bright-eyed lizards bask and run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er fallen temples gracious in decay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man’s arrogance with calculated art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boasted in marble&mdash;now the quiet heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Great Mother dreams eternal things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brief, bright roses and ethereal green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or more exuberant, sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In poppies poured profusely to the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From secret hoards of scarlet. Nothing seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But swoons with beauty&mdash;beauty everywhere&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nothing but beauty ... now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is the immortality of Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not where the city rises, dome on dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek we the living soul of ancient might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in this temple of green silence&mdash;here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flame purer than the vestal is alight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world again draws near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In reverence, but now it comes to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tribute of a nobler coin than fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wondering worship, not in fierce dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men bow the knee to what of Rome remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time’s long lustration has effaced her stains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that is perishable now is past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth her portion tenderly transmutes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To evanescent beauty of her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jubilant flowers and nectar-breathing fruits&mdash;<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_BEST_POETRY_OF_1914" id="THE_BEST_POETRY_OF_1914"></a>THE BEST POETRY OF 1914</h2>

<h3>I. TEN BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A SMALL LIBRARY.</h3>

<p>* Certain volumes of new poetry and collected editions are
drawn to the individual reader’s notice by an asterisk employed to
indicate special poetic distinction.</p>

<p>* <i>The East I Know. By Paul Claudel. Translated from the French by
Teresa Frances and William Rose Benét.</i> (Yale University Press: $1.25
net.) A volume of prose poems by one of the greatest poets living in the
world to-day. Although Paul Claudel is unknown to English readers, his
influence is the strongest shaping force there is on the young poetry of
most European countries. This volume is as much of a literary event as
the publication of John Synge’s first volume in this country. I know of
no living writer of whom we may more confidently predict immortality for
his work. The present volume reveals the soul of China in wonderful
strophes, and though perhaps the slightest of Claudel’s books, is the
volume by which Claudel may be most fittingly introduced to the American
public. If any reader can set down this volume without realizing that a
great new force in literature and life has been born into the world, he
is incapable of imaginative appreciation.</p>

<p>* <i>The Single Hound: Poems of a Lifetime. By Emily Dickinson.</i> (Little,
Brown, &amp; Co.: $1.25 net.) A new volume by one of the world’s great
spiritual artists, which contains much poetry that is imperishable as an
integral part of American literature. With Blake’s naked uncompromising
vision, and his absorption in the eternal shadows of mortality, she has
a personal and fragrant beauty of feeling and expression which is unique
and incomparable. Her verses are like flashes of lightning illumining
the chaos of our material existence. <i>The Single Hound</i> is the rich
legacy of a great spiritual imagination. There are few books in American
poetry of which we can more confidently predict immortality.</p>

<p>* <i>Collected Poems. By Norman Gale.</i> (Macmillan: $1.50 net.) The poet’s
choice of the lyrics and longer poems by which he wishes to be
definitely remembered. Indispensable to every library. No poet since the
Elizabethans has managed to convey such an infectious joy into pastoral
poetry, and the best of these poems are permanent treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span> trove for
the anthologist. Such a volume as this would alone dignify a season.</p>

<p>* <i>Georgian Poetry. Edited by E. M.</i> (Putnam: $1.50 net.) A superb
collection of representative poems by the younger English writers who
have won their reputation in the last four or five years. This book,
which has gone through nine English editions already, should meet with
as great success in this country. Here, and here only, will you find the
authentic younger singers adequately represented by hitherto unpublished
work. If this volume introduces Rupert Brooke and Lascelles Abercrombie
to America, it will have done our literature a service great enough to
justify its publication.</p>

<p>* <i>The Congo and Other Poems. By Vachel Lindsay.</i> (Macmillan: $1.25
net.) A new volume of verse by Mr. Lindsay, whose first book was the
most significant publication in American poetry last year. While this
book does not mark an advance, many of the poems written to be chanted
aloud fully sustain the poet’s reputation, and the volume is graced with
a selection of the best and less strident of the <i>Rhymes to be Traded
for Bread.</i> As the poetic interpreter of the Middle West, Mr. Lindsay is
performing a great social service, as well as a great service to poetry
by bringing it into the homes and hearts of the people. <i>The Firemen’s
Ball</i> and <i>I Heard Immanuel Singing</i> have qualities of permanence, and
in the former Mr. Lindsay has perfected a new medium of poetic
expression. But we are in danger of losing sight of Mr. Lindsay’s more
delicate talent by virtue of which he is preëminently a poet</p>

<p>* <i>The Present Hour: A Book of Poems. By Percy MacKaye.</i> (Macmillan:
$1.25 net.) The poems dealing with the present war reaffirm Mr. MacKay’s
authority of utterance, and the best of the sonnets surpass William
Watson’s “The Purple East.” But it is in “Fight” and “School” that the
poet has at last found himself and invented a medium admirably fitted to
express what he desires. These two poems have all the distinction of
Masefield with the originality and shrewdness of New England feeling,
and a homeliness which is unique in contemporary poetry. The volume
includes many poems of occasion, all adequate, and in the case of
“Goethals” and one or two others, noble. So far, Mr. MacKaye’s best
volume of poems.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<p>* <i>The Complete Poems of S. Weir Mitchell.</i> (Century Co.: $2.00 net.)
The definitive edition of Dr. Mitchell’s poetry revised according to his
final wishes. It should serve to make known to the present generation
the graceful contemplative poetry of that rival to America’s other
distinguished physician-poet, Dr. Holmes. Dr. Mitchell’s poems of
occasion at their best are equal to the best of Dr. Holmes, while his
“Ode to a Lycian Tomb” surpasses “The Chambered Nautilus.” It is one of
the anomalies of literature that Dr. Mitchell’s novels have so long
overshadowed his poetry. In this volume the best of his dramatic work is
included, and “Drake” is a play of poetic distinction in its way. The
volume may rest pleasantly with its peers on the same library shelf with
the poems of Longfellow and Holmes. It is the harvest of sixty years
devoted to poetry.</p>

<p>* <i>Songs for the New Age. By James Oppenheim.</i> (Century Co.: $1.25
net.) The most significant volume of new poetry of the year 1914, as
Vachel Lindsay’s <i>General William Booth Enters Into Heaven</i> was the most
significant volume of 1913. With more self-conscious art than Whitman,
in the verse form which Whitman was once thought to have perfected, Mr.
Oppenheim sings the joys and sorrows of the race now and to come. The
vision of these poems is swift and sure: their philosophy, mature and
American. If there is one volume of verse this year which we might
safely recommend to every American man and woman who has not read poetry
before, it is this book, where they will find their dreams and strivings
sung and interpreted in a book which has qualities of greatness. The
form of these poems is so difficult to shape perfectly that Mr.
Oppenheim’s technical achievement can only be characterized as masterly.
The volume is the only one in which the use of “polyrhythmic verse” can
claim complete justification since <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and its art is as
individual as its matter. <i>Songs for the New Age</i> may reaffirm much of
Whitman, but they do not echo him. The volume will prove more and more
satisfying with each rereading. And its message to the American people
may not pass unheeded.</p>

<p>* <i>The Grand Canyon, and Other Poems. By Henry Van Dyke.</i> (Scribner:
$1.25 net.) Poetry of the quality familiar to Dr. Van Dyke’s readers,
and fully equal to the poetry in his earlier volumes. To the more
serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span> poems are added several delightfully humorous poems of
occasion, among which <i>Ars Agricolaris</i> is a classic of its kind.</p>

<p>* <i>The Flight, and Other Poems. By George Edward Woodberry.</i> (Macmillan
$1.25 net.) Mr. Woodberry’s finest volume of verse, in which he gives
expression to many moods of intellectual beauty and a philosophy of the
ideal akin to Shelley. It contains one lyric, <i>Comrades</i>, absolutely
peerless and worthy to be set beside Browning’s <i>The Guardian Angel</i>, if
it does not surpass it. These poems are the fruit of a ripe culture and
a passionate idealism thoroughly American in its voicing of its message.
One of the most completely satisfying volumes of the year.</p>

<h3>II. TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGER LIBRARY.</h3>

<p><i>The List of ten books printed above and the following fifteen
titles:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>* <i>In Deep Places. By Amelia Josephine Burr.</i> (Doran: $1.00 net.) Fine
dramatic monologues and narrative poems, which represent a great advance
over Miss Burr’s previous book. <i>Jehane</i> is a worthy sequel to <i>The
Haystack in the Floods</i> by William Morris. <i>Allah is With the Patient</i>
and other narrative poems are related in a blank verse of firm yet
varied texture. Miss Burr’s dramatic imagination interprets Italy and
England in human terms, and travel has afforded her lyric opportunities
to which she has responded sensitively and well. With this volume Miss
Burr has come to stay.</p>

<p>* <i>The Little King. By Witter Bynner.</i> (Kennerley: $.60 net.) A stark
one-act play in verse of swift sure dramatic nerve about the little son
of Marie Antoinette. With great economy of material and vivid historic
imagination, Mr. Bynner has made <i>The Little King</i> human and poignant in
his brief little tragedy.</p>

<p>* <i>Earth Deities, and Other Rhythmic Masques. By Bliss Carman and Mary
Perry King.</i> (Kennerley: $1.50 net.) Four masques of earth with Mr.
Carman’s old familiar lyric quality directed into fresh and living
channels. Each of them would afford a rare delight to an audience,
particularly if accompanied by the rhythmic dances which have been
designed for them by Mary Perry King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

<p>* <i>Poetical Works. By Edward Dowden. In two volumes.</i> (Dutton: $4.00
net.) A permanent and integral part of English literature. It is
gratifying to find tardy justice done at last to the merits of the late
Professor Dowden as a poet. Those who care for the work of Mr. Woodberry
will find the same qualities in Dowden’s poetry, but in a larger and
more authoritative voice. Moreover, he is one of the great nineteenth
century sonneteers. His many hymns to intellectual beauty have not an
undistinguished line in them, and as a lyric poet his singing quality is
infectious. This is the first edition of his poems since 1876, and
contains many which have never been collected before. The second volume
is a pleasant translation of Goethe’s, <i>The West Eastern Divan</i>. It will
not greatly interest admirers of Prof. Dowden’s work, and should be sold
separately.</p>

<p>* <i>Borderlands and Thoroughfares. By Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.</i>
(Macmillan: $1.25 net.) Mr. Gibson’s fourth volume in three years.
Though not equal to his earlier books, it will well repay the lover of
poetry. The first section, entitled <i>Borderlands</i> consists of three
dramatic dialogues in free verse which aim with some success to be
simple, sensuous, and passionate. <i>Hoops</i> is one of Mr. Gibson’s most
satisfactory poems. The second section, entitled <i>Thoroughfares</i>
comprises shorter poems, many of which are dramatic monologues, and of
these <i>Solway Ford</i> and <i>The Gorse</i> represent Mr. Gibson’s best. As we
have said elsewhere, Mr. Gibson’s art “satisfies our æsthetic emotions
and fulfils our social needs.”</p>

<p>* <i>Aroun’ the Boreens: A Little Book of Celtic Verse. By Agnes I.
Hanrahan.</i> (Badger: $1.00 net.) A slight volume of Irish songs equal to
the very best by Eva Gore-Booth or Mrs. Hinkson, and tipped with a more
delicate art. The volume should be on every shelf beside Moira O’Neill’s
<i>Songs of the Glens of Antrim</i>.</p>

<p>* <i>The Cry of Youth. By Harry Kemp.</i> (Kennerley: $1.25 net.) Terse
ringing ballads of modern life with much of Buchanan’s quality and keen
technique. Despite the propagandist note, which is less insistent than
in most poetry of a socialistic tendency, Mr. Kemp has succeeded with
some quiet reserve in making the reader feel the pity of lonely outcast
life, and in expressing his philosophy in genuine poetry. The sincerity
of his work is unquestionable, and the volume merits a critical
attention on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span> merits which we should be anxious to assist. <i>The Cry
of Youth</i> is not written solely for an audience of poets and critics. It
is genuine poetry of cruelly naked emotion borne unflinchingly.</p>

<p>* <i>Songs of the Dead End. By Patrick MacGill.</i> (Kennerley: $1.25 net.)
Poetry of labor and poetry without a brief in about equal measure.
Though the former is fine, Mr. MacGill’s best work is to be found in the
latter. The poet has been a navvy, a miner, a switchman, a car-coupler,
a tramp, and a plate-layer, and out of grinding poverty and toil his
poetry has emerged. There is danger of a wrong emphasis on his social
poetry. It is good, but not better than that of several others. The less
premeditated lyrics will give the greatest pleasure to the reader, and
to many of them one will turn again and again.</p>

<p>* <i>Philip the King, and Other Poems. By John Masefield.</i> (Macmillan:
$1.25 net.) A one-act play in verse which is competent but would not be
distinctive were it not for a superb ballad of the Armada, which
challenges comparison with Drayton. Four other poems of strong beauty
which redeem the rest of the volume, and make it necessary to poetry
lovers. The notable war-poem entitled <i>August, 1914</i>, is included.</p>

<p>* <i>The Wine-Press: A Tale of War. By Alfred Noyes.</i> (Stokes: $.60 net.)
A tale of the horror of war and its blind futility, whose scene is laid
in the Balkans. It is told with all of Mr. Noyes’s art and its awful
lesson should be particularly timely in the midst of the present
struggle. The poem is a hymn to liberty passionately voiced, and brings
death and suffering home in relentless poetry.</p>

<p>* <i>Songs of Labor, and Other Poems. By Morris Rosenfeld. Translated
from the Yiddish by Rose Pastor Stokes and Helena Frank.</i> (Badger: $.75
net.) An excellent translation of the poems of an American Yiddish poet
of poignant beauty, whose work has hitherto not been accessible to
English readers except in an incomplete prose version. The present
translation includes many poems now published for the first time, and is
adorned with two remarkable illustrations in black and white which
reveal new possibilities in line. A volume which deserves to go through
many editions.</p>

<p>* <i>Poems. By Clinton Scollard.</i> (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.25 net.) A
selection of Mr. Scollard’s best poems from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> numerous volumes. It
should serve to define his place in American poetry, which is beside Mr.
Cawein. Delicate fancy and a love of nature which is not vague are
united to an opulence of expression which has not always done Mr.
Scollard service, but which in almost every poem in this volume results
in giving the pleasure of fine poetic sensation to the discriminating
reader.</p>

<p><i>Songs and Sonnets for England in War Time.</i> (Lane: $.75 net.) A
collection of the best poems by English poets inspired by the war,
issued for the benefit of the Prince of Wales Fund. The total profits of
the volume are turned over to this fund for relief work, and the
purchaser will not only procure a volume whose significance will be more
and more realised as time passes, but will be contributing in small
measure to this charitable work.</p>

<p>* <i>Challenge. By Louis Untermeyer.</i> (Century Co.: $1.00 net) One of the
most significant new volumes of the year. With much of Shelley’s social
enthusiasm and a genuine inspiration, he sings the strength and weakness
of our democracy with the eagerness of youth. This is a volume whose
significance will grow as the years go by, and it should be associated
with Mr. Oppenheim’s new volume on which comment will be found
elsewhere. Although democracy is the substance of his song, yet the
feeling for beauty’s essence which here finds lyrical expression is the
most substantially satisfying quality of his work.</p>

<h3>III. SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF SIGNIFICANT BOOKS OF POETRY FOR A LARGE
LIBRARY</h3>

<p>* <i>Earth Triumphant, and Other Tales in Verse. By Conrad Aiken.</i>
(Macmillan: $1.25 net.) Three narrative poems of distinction, followed
by shorter poems interpreting the philosophy of youth. They suggest
comparison with the longer poems of John Masefield, but have a firm
independent technique of their own. With genuine beauty they relate
tales which reveal the heart of modern life in various phases of youth,
and contain a reading of earth which differs in essentials from that of
Meredith. The volume deserves a wider audience than the usual public
which cares for poetry. It has a message which every American will
appreciate, and if it helps to spread an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span> interest in poetry among new
circles of readers, it will only be fulfilling its mission. It is a
distinguished first book of verse.</p>

<p><i>Poems. By Walter Conrad Arensberg.</i> (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.00 net.) The
most artistic volume of poetry this year in its technique. Aloofness,
controlled emotion, conscious art, are the characteristics of his
poetry. Despite an occasional <i>bizarrerie</i>, despite echoes of Verlaine
and Laforgue, Mr. Arensberg is a classicist. His technique is faultless.
Each line is not only exquisite in itself, but it is perfectly
coördinated with every other line. If these poems leave the reader cold,
they offer an abundant intellectual compensation for the “thrills” of
other poets. The special qualities of his verse are unique in American
poetry, and will surely appeal to a discriminating circle, though his
work is unlikely to become popular.</p>

<p><i>The Minor Poems of Joseph Beaumont. Edited by Eloise Robinson.</i>
(Houghton-Mifflin: $5.00 net.) An authoritative text of Joseph
Beaumont’s minor poems edited from a manuscript in the possession of
Professor George Herbert Palmer. The poems are preceded by a critical
introduction and followed by a brief but careful textual apparatus.
While Beaumont was a very minor poet, the fact remains that he was a
significant member of the group of metaphysical poets of whom Vaughan
was the greatest, and this volume must take its place in any collection
of English poetry which claims to be even reasonably complete.</p>

<p><i>The Falconer of God, and Other Poems. By William Rose Benét.</i> (Yale
University Press: $1.25 net.) Mr. Benét’s second collection marks an
advance in facility combined with a greater restraint and reticence. It
includes many fine ballads, and several dramatic soliloquies only
surpassed this year by those in Miss Burr’s new volume. Although there
is much which is experimental in the book, it is successful experiment,
and Mr. Benét’s range of expression is continually broadening.</p>

<p>* <i>Auguries. By Laurence Binyon.</i> (Lane: $1.00 net.) One of the most
satisfying collections of verse of a noteworthy poet who is too little
known and appreciated in this country. Its grave classical beauty will
never assure it popularity, but at its best it is worthy to stand beside
Mr. Bridges, and it contains no poem that is not excellent. <i>Ferry
Hinksey</i> is a lyric which no future anthologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span> can overlook. Next to
Mr. Arensberg’s poems, the most satisfying new volume artistically of
the year. It demands silence and complete surrender.</p>

<p><i>Broad-Sheet Ballads. With An Introduction by Padraic Colum.</i> (Norman,
Remington: $.75 net.) A narrow, but good, selection of the best of the
Broad-Sheet Ballads which occupy so definite a place in Irish poetry.
These waifs and strays have been gathered previously in various
collections, but never before in a volume calculated to appeal to the
general public. An introduction telling the story of this form of art
and the characteristics of its audiences and appeal to them is prefixed.</p>

<p>* <i>Syrinx: Pastels of Hellas. By Mitchell S. Buck.</i> (Claire-Marie:
$1.25 net.) A volume of prose poems of reticent Pagan art, suggestive of
the best work of Pierre Louys. Unique in American poetry, and really
beautiful.</p>

<p><i>In the High Hills. By Maxwell Struthers Burt.</i> (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.25
net.) The verse in this volume is of a kind that has eminent qualities
without eminent distinction. The earnestness and sincerity of Mr. Burt’s
poetic moods give to his poetry those sound qualities which at least
compel attention, if they do not excite the emotions. The elements of
poetry are not fused with imaginative heat in his work, and hence it
lacks magic, but it reflects the gentlemanly feeling of a lover of
poetry in verse which demands respect.</p>

<p><i>The Sun-Thief, and Other Poems. By Rhys Carpenter.</i> (Oxford University
Press: $1.75 net.) Competent academic verse on classical models,
including a new version of the Prometheus legend.</p>

<p><i>The Poet and Nature: What He Saw and What He Heard. By Madison Cawein.</i>
(John P. Morton &amp; Co.: Louisville, Kentucky. $1.50.) A volume of prose
and verse designed to encourage a love of poetry in children. The first
half of the volume is in the form of a juvenile story with previously
published lyrics of Mr. Cawein interspersed as examples of poetic
beauty: the second half of the volume consists of hitherto uncollected
poems of nature by Mr. Cawein now gathered together under the title of
<i>The Morning Road</i>. This part of the volume should give especial
pleasure to Mr. Cawein’s readers.</p>

<p><i>Green Days and Blue Days. By Patrick R. Chalmers.</i> (Norman, Remington:
$1.00 net.) A pleasant volume of light verse by a contributor to
<i>Punch</i>. The verses do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> pretend to be more than agreeable
diversions, and reflect the lighter moods of life happily and in
delicate numbers.</p>

<p><i>At the Shrine, and Other Poems. By George Herbert Clarke.</i> (Stewart and
Kidd: $1.25 net.) A pleasant unassuming collection of somewhat academic
verse reflecting a life of scholarly leisure. The closing section of
letters in verse to departed novelists is particularly happy, recalling
at no great distance the similar work of Austin Dobson.</p>

<p>* <i>Path Flower. By Olive Tilford Dargan.</i> (Scribner: $1.25 net.) With
this volume of lyrical poems Olive Tilford Dargan definitely takes her
place as one of our foremost younger poets. With much of Francis
Thompson’s vision of an overarching heaven and a shadowed earth, and
also much of Thompson’s mannerism, she is herself in the best of these
poems, in which she treats high themes with high artistic fervor. Her
feeling for landscape is English in its delicacy, and she has
interpreted the influence of nature on human life and its incidence with
clear insight and sympathy. No one will deny Mrs. Dargan’s poetic
inspiration or the refinement of her vision.</p>

<p><i>Florence on a Certain Night, and Other Poems. By Coningsby Dawson.</i>
(Holt: $1.25 net.) A volume of undistinguished literary verse by a
distinguished novelist.</p>

<p>* <i>America and Other Poems. By W. J. Dawson.</i> (Lane: $1.25 net.) The
expression of an ideal America as seen by one with an alien tradition.
The volume includes several fine ballad narratives, notably “The Kiss,”
“Salome,” and the swift sure rhythmic “Last Ride of the Sheik Abdullah;”
above all, “Blake’s Homecoming,” a member of the royal line of English
ballads. In addition to competent lyrics on various themes, special
attention should be called to the poems of childhood and the delicately
imagined meditative poems of religious feeling. So many religious poems
rely wholly on a good intention, “more fit to pave Hell than cause
rejoicing in Heaven,” as a French critic says, that exceptions should be
noted. The volume marks an appreciable advance over Dr. Dawson’s
previous collections.</p>

<p><i>A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century for the Seven Hundredth Anniversary
of Roger Bacon. The Text by John Erskine.</i> (Columbia University Press.)
A pageant reflecting the culture and endeavor of the thirteenth century
in every field. The text is in verse of fine tex<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span>ture and imaginative
expression by Professor Erskine of Columbia University. While the
pageant itself has been deferred because of the war, it is still
possible to enjoy the text, and to look forward to the pageant’s
representation in the near future.</p>

<p><i>Lux Juventutis: A Book of Verse. By Katharine A. Esdaile.</i>
(Houghton-Mifflin: $1.25 net.) The first volume of a young English poet
who shows considerable promise. It is characterised by classical
restraint and a fine feeling for form, and does not lack singing
quality.</p>

<p>* <i>Sonnets from the Patagonian. By Donald Evans.</i> (Claire-Marie: $1.25
net.) Eighteen impressionistic sonnets of exotic workmanship, suggesting
the fantasy of Laforgue, but more extremely composed in disembodied
words. They rely on tone color for much of their effect, and are bizarre
to the point of irony. However, they grow on the reader as he becomes
familiar with them, and their consummate art is unquestionable.</p>

<p>* <i>Sonnets of a Portrait-Painter. By Arthur Davison Ficke.</i> (Kennerley:
$1.00 net.) A sequence of fifty-seven sonnets in an undeservedly
neglected form, which do not recall too definitely Meredith’s <i>Modern
Love</i>. They are extremely subtle and their intellectual content is very
closely woven, so that they will prove difficult reading, but they repay
careful study, and in many sonnets the lyric impulse has happily
overmastered the poet completely. A collection which is worthy of
several readings.</p>

<p>* <i>Arrows in the Gale. By Arturo Giovannitti.</i> (Hillacre Bookhouse,
Riverside, Connecticut: $1.25 net.) One of the more important volumes of
new verse this year. A passionate voicing of social injustice in
imaginative strophes, which introduce a new poetic form with
considerable art. <i>The Cage</i>, when printed in the Atlantic Monthly, last
year, was called the most significant poem published in that periodical
since Moody’s <i>Ode in Time of Hesitation</i>. The volume claims a hearing
as fine poetry rather than as an expression of Syndicalism. There is an
appreciative introduction by Helen Keller which is good criticism.</p>

<p>* <i>My Lady’s Book. By Gerald Gould.</i> (Kennerley: $1.00 net.) Twenty
lyrics of pure song quality which are almost faultless in their
perfection, though in a minor key. A volume to afford pure delight by
its unaffected lyric quality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Poems. By Katharine Howard.</i> (Sherman, French: $1.00 net.) Minor verse
in <i>vers libre</i>, which is frequently pleasing and always individual. It
is the expression of a whimsical personality who wears her singing robes
lightly, and who is most successful in verse of macabre suggestion.</p>

<p>* <i>Des Imagistes: An Anthology.</i> (Boni: $1.00.) The best collection of
“imagiste” poetry, in which the work of Ford Madox Hueffer, F. S. Flint,
Amy Lowell, and others is represented. There are many poems in the
volume which will give pleasure, but as a collection it is uneven and
rather tenuous. The work of F. S. Flint which it contains justifies the
volume’s purchase.</p>

<p><i>The Thresher’s Wife. By Harry Kemp.</i> (Boni: $.40 net.) A narrative poem
well told in the manner of Masefield, whose influence upon it has been
great.</p>

<p>* <i>Trees, and Other Poems. By Joyce Kilmer.</i> (Doran: $1.00 net.) The
spirit of youth and grave faith expressed in lyric numbers. This slight
little book defines a personality of poetic interest. The book shows
less alien influence than most recent American poetry, and is quite
individual in its affirmations. Though unassuming, the book will not
meet with just treatment unless we recognize the fine lyric
accomplishment of such poems as <i>Trees</i> and <i>Martin</i>. Is this volume the
prelude of a little Catholic Renaissance in American poetry?</p>

<p>* <i>The Shadow of Ætna. By Louie V. Ledoux.</i> (Putnam: $1.00 net.)
Severely chaste poetry on classical models of distinguished beauty. They
reveal fine intellectual feeling that recalls Shelley in its intensity
and Arnold in its disciplined reticence. They have all the warmth of
life seen against an eternal background, and a passionate message which
cannot go unheeded.</p>

<p>* <i>The Sharing. By Agnes Lee.</i> (Sherman, French: $1.00 net.) Agnes
Lee’s new book has all her familiar qualities, but in addition it
presents a new criticism of life which reveals a feeling for human
values akin in many respects to that of Browning. In its brevity and
search for the polished word, it suggests the sculptor’s art, and many
of these poems would have pleased Landor for their freight of suggestion
and elemental simplicity.</p>

<p>* <i>Sword Blades and Poppy Seed. By Amy Lowell.</i> (Macmillan: $1.25 net.)
A volume, not only of interesting experiment in <i>vers libre</i> and exotic
rhythms, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span> notable accomplishment in poetry. Though associated
with the “imagiste” school of English poetry, Miss Lowell’s talent is
independent of it, and in her narrative and lyric poems alike one feels
an artistic firmness and restraint which results in clear vision clearly
sung. Best of all, this “imagiste” poetry is healthy and able to fight
for its existence. In so far as it is derivative from French influences
it adds a new note to English verse, and reveals a subtle use of free
cadenced rhythms which is fully responsive to the mood and feeling of
the poem. Far more genuine and spontaneous than Miss Lowell’s first
volume.</p>

<p><i>The Passing Singer and Other Poems. By Samuel Henry Marcus.</i> (Stratford
Pub. Co.: $1.00 net.) A modest first volume which is likely to receive
less attention than it deserves. Mr. Marcus has not yet found himself in
poetry, but he sings the present condition of humanity sincerely and
passionately. When he sings it simply, he will be more satisfying, but
this volume will give pleasure to any one who really cares for poetry.</p>

<p>* <i>Poems. By Edward Sandford Martin.</i> (Scribner: $1.50 net.) The
collected verse of the Editor of <i>Life</i>. Mellow Horatian philosophy and
wit not yet frost-bitten by a man whom Dr. Johnson would have pronounced
clubbable and with whom Boswells must feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p><i>You and I. By Harriet Monroe.</i> (Macmillan: $1.25 net.) A bulky volume
of verse by the editor of <i>Poetry: A Magazine Of Verse</i>. In it the
social note is voiced strongly, and expression is given to many phases
of modern effort, but its intellectual content rather overshadows its
lyric quality.</p>

<p>* <i>The Sea is Kind. By T. Sturge Moore.</i> (Houghton-Mifflin: $1.50 net.)
This is the first collection issued in America of the poems of an
English craftsman of great distinction and power, whose chief weakness
is an over-proportion of intellectual substance. He lacks the glow of
beauty, and perhaps of beauty’s realization, but his work is literary
craftsmanship of the highest order, and his metrical experiments are
almost as significant as those of Mr. Bridges. Altogether the artistic
product of a richly stored mind without aspiration or imaginative
vision.</p>

<p>* <i>Saloon Sonnets: With Sunday Flutings. By Allen Norton.</i>
(Claire-Marie: $1.25 net.) A volume less bizarre than its title implies.
The sonnets bear evidence of <i>ueberkultur</i>, but occasionally surprise
the reader by their pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span>ant lyric charm. They do not lack virility and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><i>The Sister of the Wind. By Grace Fallow Norton.</i> (Houghton-Mifflin:
$1.00 net.) A new volume by the author of <i>Little Gray Songs from St.
Joseph’s</i> which is most disappointing. In a poet of Miss Norton’s
quality, it is inevitable that there should be always something to repay
the reader, but this volume is singularly unrepresentative of Miss
Norton’s real powers.</p>

<p><i>Celtic Memories. By Norreys Jephson O’Conor.</i> (Lane: $1.00 net.) A
first volume of some promise by a recent graduate of Harvard, whose
Irish feeling is drawn directly from experience, but whose expression is
still drawn chiefly from books.</p>

<p>* <i>The Ebon Muse and Other Poems by Léon Laviaux. Englished by John
Myers O’Hara.</i> (Smith and Sale: $2.00 net.) Translations from the work
of a young Creole poet, glorifying the “fille de couleur” in love poetry
of original beauty. Differing from Latin and Oriental passion alike, it
reveals a type of feminine beauty which is wholly new to Northern
readers.</p>

<p>* <i>An Epilogue To the Praise of Angus and Other Poems. By Seumas
O’Sullivan.</i> (Norman, Remington Co.: $.75 net.) A thin sheaf of delicate
poems by one of the foremost poets of the New Ireland. Akin in certain
aspects of his vision to “Æ,” who does not surpass him, his verses have
more singing quality, and he is a successful experimenter in various new
verse forms which reproduce cadences in ancient Irish music.</p>

<p>* <i>One Woman to Another, and Other Poems. By Corinne Roosevelt
Robinson.</i> (Scribner: $1.25 net.) Dramatic monologues and sonnets of
sharply etched lines whose competence is unquestionable, and a more
satisfying reality of human feeling than in Mrs. Robinson’s previous
volume. The volume will give much intellectual and some emotional
pleasure, and in two or three lyrics the poet has achieved high ground.</p>

<p>* <i>Beyond the Breakers, and other Poems. By George Sterling.</i>
(Robertson: $1.25 net.) This is Mr. Sterling’s first thoroughly
satisfying book. It includes the superb “Ode on the Centenary of the
Birth of Robert Browning,” and poems of such importance as “Tidal, King
of Nations,” “Willy Pitcher,” “The Mission Swallows,” “Past the Panes,”
and “You Never Can Tell.” We must call<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> particular attention to the
vision of the noble ode entitled “Beyond the Sunset.” With less opulent
diction and heady imagination than Mr. Sterling’s earlier volumes,
<i>Beyond the Breakers</i> shows a disciplined vision expressed with a
disciplined technique.</p>

<p><i>Open Water. By Arthur Stringer.</i> (Lane: $1.00 net) A collection of
delicate pictures expressing many frail and drifting moods phrased in
<i>vers libre</i> not yet quite sure of itself. The volume contains much
quiet beauty, and is prefaced by a plea for <i>vers libre</i> of considerable
documentary and critical value. A volume which the lover of poetry can
scarcely neglect.</p>

<p><i>Idylls of Greece. Third Series. By Howard V. Sutherland.</i> (Fitzgerald:
$1.00 net) Modest idylls of Greek fable telling with some passages of
beauty the tales of “Idas and Marpessa,” “Rhodanthe,” “Sappho and
Phaon,” and “Œnone.” The blank verse, though not firm, is of
well-wrought texture, and Mr. Sutherland expresses feelingly the
fleeting beauty of Pagan love and Hellenic landscape. Mr. Sutherland’s
three volumes merit more attention than they have received.</p>

<p><i>The Poems of François Villon. Translated by H. De Vere Stacpoole.</i>
(Lane: $1.50 net) A convenient edition of Villon’s best work, in which a
reasonably accurate text of the two Testaments and the best of the
Ballades and Rondels is printed, together with a running commentary, a
vivid introduction, and translations of some of the shorter poems with
dubious success. However, the volume is the best popular service to
Villon that has yet been performed in this country, and should be on the
library shelf.</p>

<p>* <i>Little Verse for a Little Clan. By F.D.W.</i> (Published Privately: Not
for Sale.) A slight little volume of thirty-five pages of delicate
workmanship, which contain poems that make the book rank among the very
best of the year. I know of very few books written by Americans which
would afford the pleasure to discriminating readers that this volume
would offer were it to be published in a form accessible to all. It is
as delicate, at its best, as Beeching and Mackail’s <i>Love in Idleness</i>,
and will please all lovers of <i>A Shropshire Lad</i>. It is just the sort of
book which Mr. Mosher used to delight in finding for the American
public. I shall be glad to give further information about it to
inquirers.</p>

<p><i>Eris: A Dramatic Allegory. By Blanche Shoemaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> Wagstaff.</i> (Moffat,
Yard, and Co.: $1.00 net.) A short dramatic allegory in which the
elements of poetry are present, but which is hardly successful in fusing
them into life. There are several pages of genuine poetry which prove
the certainty of the poet’s ultimate accomplishment, and much competent
craftsmanship. This is an honest book, whose weakness is that the
imagination of the reader has no suggestive substance to feed upon.</p>

<p><i>Justification: A Philosophic Phantasy. By John H. White.</i> (Richard G.
Badger: $1.00.) A poem in four short cantos and though philosophic in
conception is full of abstract idealisms. The author has a fruitful
imagination, but his reasoning on the origin and destiny of human life
is profound. The verse, though concrete, is flexible.</p>

<p>* <i>The Collected Poems of Margaret L. Woods.</i> (Lane: $1.50 net.) The
definitive edition of the poetry and drama of a great weaver of words
and emotion, who unites to much of Lionel Johnson’s repressed sombreness
a sustained beauty of musical effect which was characteristic of the
earlier poet. Mrs. Woods has performed for Oxford the poetic service
that Johnson performed for Winchester, and in other poems has added new
immortalities to Westminster Abbey’s crown. The plays are finely wrought
and deeply felt, and together with the lyrics, place Mrs. Woods in the
authentic English poetic line.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

edition.
